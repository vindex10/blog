# Installing intel vtune profiler on Gentoo
A place to start: https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune-install-guide-linux

We will install only cli version of vtune, GUI version requires additional handling of X11 dependencies,
gtk libs and glibc. For some reason installed didn't find some of them in my system, although they were installed.

Below you will find interactive procedure, check here for the silent approach: https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune-install-guide-linux-auto-install

## Interactive install

* Download source

Go here https://software.intel.com/en-us/VTUNE/CHOOSE-DOWNLOAD and follow a bunch of steps including
authentication (you should register an account at https://software.intel.com)

* After unpacking run `./install.sh`. You can do it with user permissions, no need for `root`.

Agree with terms of use, make sure to choose writeable directory (since we are running installer
as a regular user), remember **(!)** to remove tick for the gui component.

* After required files have been installed, you'll find `vtune_profiler` symlink in your install directory.

## Sampling driver

By default vtune build required kernel modules for making use of event-based sampling. Why you might need it?
Read here: https://software.intel.com/en-us/vtune-install-guide-linux-what-features-are-available-if-i-install-intel-vtune-profiler-as-a-non-root-or-non-administrator-user

If you decided to build it, follow me :)

* Go to `install_dir/vtune_profiler/sepdk/src`. It should exist if installation of `vtune` passed successfully.

* You can try running `./build-driver` rightaway, though it didn't work for me. I've got the following error:

Based on some random answer from github: https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU/issues/75#issuecomment-318832002
I discovered the following piece of code in `install_dir/vtune_profiler/sepdk/src/vtsspp/sched.c`:

```c++
#if 0 & LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(4,11,0)
#include <linux/sched/task.h>
#include <linux/sched/task_stack.h>
#include <linux/sched/mm.h>
#include <linux/sched/signal.h>
#endif
```

As suggested in the thread, exactly these lines are required to fix the issue. For some reason intel developers commented this out.
Let's do the reverse job:

```c++
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(4,11,0)
#include <linux/sched/task.h>
#include <linux/sched/task_stack.h>
#include <linux/sched/mm.h>
#include <linux/sched/signal.h>
#endif
```

After applying this change, I managed to run `./build-driver` without errors.

* Drivers built. Now to use `vtune` you should do two things:

Load kernel-modules (as root now):

```bash
root# install_dir/vtune_profiler/sepdk/src/insmod-sep
```

Load env-vars for vtune and sep:

```bash
source install_dir/vtune_profiler/sep_vars.sh
source install_dir/vtune_profiler/vtune-vars.sh
```
