title: Packing fraction of globular protein cores is always close to 55%
---

> The researchers, led by Corey O'Hern, developed computational models for all [globular proteins](https://phys.org/tags/globular+proteins/) in the Protein Data Bank, an online database, and measured their interior core regions to determine how densely packed they were. Every protein had a core packing fraction of 55%. That is, 55% of the space was occupied by atoms. That led the research team to two questions.
