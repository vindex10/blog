Now I know who was behind all the best quests of my childhood!!

[Ron Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Gilbert) programmed Freddy Fish and Putt-Putt, worked at Lucasfilm Games (later LucasArts).

I missed the [Monkey Island](https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/monkeyisland) series, incl. the Mokey Island 2 in which Ron participated as a director, designer and a writer.
