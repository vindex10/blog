> He found that too much of YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer’s risk in humans, leads to amyloid build-up, an accumulation that is a hallmark of the neurodegenerative disease.

There are countless studies that highlight how genetics or lifestyle and other factors that result in a reduction of estrogen signaling are associated with Alzheimer's. Estrogen, primarily activated at night decreases the expression of the YKL-40 gene. All of the known interventions, from vitamin D, Mg, to gut, choline, etc all can improve estrogen signaling, decreasing YKL-40 gene. One can end up with Alzheimer's from many different routes so interventions depend on the person.

The various stuff that has been found to reduces dementia also improve estrogen signaling. Estrogens are an incredibly old hormone used in regulating a ton of basic cell function. Keep ERa functioning well and you get not only better amyloid plaque clearance, but healthier DNA repair, immune system, etc and better neurogenesis. A lot of stuff that improves longevity ultimately just keeps this going.

There is a Alzheimer's Choline camp which is where we know that Choline supplements is associated with improved Alzheimer's. With low estrogen signaling you have lower N-methyltransferase so less Choline in the body as it is how the body makes it. Less Choline, less SAM via BHMT, less SAM, less clearance of 2-OHE1, less ERa activation, and ... less choline in a loop. Supplement with Choline and it helps not only with the APOE e4 which consumes more Choline, but undoes this is what this theory is about.
