When I shared a file with someone, and then want to: unshare and share with someone else.

Can the sharing link be reset for a particular file / folder? 

* GDrive: copy file, then link will change. No way to reset the link. [community answer from 2021](https://support.google.com/drive/thread/113632427/is-there-any-method-to-reset-shared-link?hl=en)
* Dropbox: you can reset, set expiration date, etc [dropbox docs](https://help.dropbox.com/share/set-link-permissions)

NOTE on Dropbox:

> You can only delete shared links that you create. If you invite someone to a file or folder with editing access, they can create their own link to share with someone else. You canâ€™t manage those shared links
