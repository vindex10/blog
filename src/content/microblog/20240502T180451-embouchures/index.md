The word *embouchure* originates from the French bouche - mouth.
One of its meanings describes the mouth-work musicians do to extract sounds from brass musical instruments.
More popularly, embouchures are those soft parts of the headphones that usually wear out too quickly :) 

You are welcome, now you can't unsee the link between headphones and lips wrapping a musical instrument!
