title: AudioBookshelf with Kobo sync bridge
---

Another thread I was following closely, is an open source alternative to Kindle's whispersync.
Combination of Audiobookshelf + Kobo reader can give you the same experience provided there is a sync service between them :) 

And it was implemented recently, and is actively maintained still!
