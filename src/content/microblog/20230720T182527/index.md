a python library for parsing rss feeds: [feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)

Initially developed by Mark Pilgrim, whose book about HTML5 I read when HTML5 was a big hype.

Another interesting fact, [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) contributed to this library.

Last but not least, the library is still under active development today!
