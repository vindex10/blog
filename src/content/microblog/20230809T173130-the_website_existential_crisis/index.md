Redesigning a website goes beyond applying a fresh coat of CSS: it can (and maybe should) make your project go through an existential crisis. You need to put words on who you are, what you do, for whom, and who youâ€™re talking to. It requires stepping out of your comfort zone but it rewards you with a better compass for your project.
